      Installation and plan effect
  </b>
    <p>
      And sometimes it happens that we have chosen some plan, some set of actions or attitudes that seem to work for someone else, <br>
       someone grows, rises up, but it does not work for us.<br>
  </p>
    <p>
      So, to begin with, this attitude or plan needs to be analyzed, evaluated, <br>
       so to speak, to notice where something is wrong, and then replaced or adapted to something that may be closer to you.<br>
  </p>
  <p>
    We all have different experiences, different pictures of the world, <br>
     and different words and actions that respond or work for us.<br>
</p>
<p class="scroll">
  Recipe for getting rid of procrastination
Rest → think about whether I really need it and what for (find a reason if necessary) → <br>
check if you have a plan, how you follow it and what in it may not work → ask your inner critic to be quieter.
